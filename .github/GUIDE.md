* **Label Taxonomy Table:** (The hex colors you'll use in GitHub settings).

### 2. Unified Label Taxonomy 
To keep your issue trackers looking clean, use these specific hex colors across all your repositories. This makes the "Still Systems" workshop feel visually anchored.

| Label | Color | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **type:bug** | `#D73A4A` (Red) | Something isn't working. |
| **type:feature** | `#A2EEEF` (Blue) | New functionality request. |
| **good first issue** | `#7057FF` (Purple) | Great for new contributors. |
| **priority:high** | `#B60205` (Dark Red) | Needs immediate attention. |
| **status:blocked** | `#000000` (Black) | Waiting on external factors. |
| **documentation** | `#0075CA` (Dark Blue) | Improvements to READMEs or docs. | 

*************************************************************

Standardize GitHub Actions (CI workflows, linting, tests, release automation) and expose their status via badges.
To achieve "Structural Clarity" in your GitHub Actions, you should treat your workflows like code: modular, reusable, and consistently named. Since you are building Python-based tools (`nexus-v`) and package buckets (`scoop-bucket`), your automation needs to handle both code quality and release distribution.

## 1. The Core Workflow Stack
For a Still Systems project, I recommend three standard workflow files located in `.github/workflows/`:

### `ci.yml` (Linting & Testing)
This is your "Stability" check. It should run on every Push and Pull Request.
* **Linting:** Use `ruff` (it’s the fastest Python linter/formatter, fitting your "Zero-Cost/High-Performance" preference).
* **Testing:** Use `pytest`.
* **Badge Link:** `https://github.com/stillsystems/REPO_NAME/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg`

### `release.yml` (Automation)
Triggered only when you create a new **Tag** or **GitHub Release**.
* **Tasks:** Build the package, upload binaries to the release, and (if applicable) update the `nexus-v` core.
* **Badge Link:** `https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/stillsystems/REPO_NAME?style=flat-square&color=111827`

### `stale.yml` (Maintenance)
A "Workshop Housekeeping" script that automatically labels or closes inactive issues to keep the repo from looking abandoned.

---

## 2. Standardized Badge Layout
Place these at the very top of your README, immediately under the one-line description. Use the **Flat Square** style and your brand's **Slate** color (`#111827`) for a unified look.

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/stillsystems/REPO_NAME/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stillsystems/REPO_NAME/actions)
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/stillsystems/REPO_NAME?style=flat-square&color=111827)](https://github.com/stillsystems/REPO_NAME/releases)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/stillsystems/REPO_NAME?style=flat-square&color=111827)](LICENSE)
```

---

## 3. The "Still Systems" Action Template (Python)
Here is a standardized `ci.yml` you can drop into `nexus-v`. It uses `uv` for speed, aligning with your current local dev environment.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Install uv
        run: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      - name: Lint and Format
        run: |
          uv run ruff check .
          uv run ruff format --check .

      - name: Run Tests
        run: uv run pytest
```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1.  **Create the files:** Add the `.yml` files to the `.github/workflows/` directory in each repository.
2.  **Update the README:** Paste the badge Markdown into the template we finalized.
3.  **Branch Protection:** In GitHub Settings, enable "Require status checks to pass before merging" for the `main` branch. This enforces your "Stability" trait.

By standardizing these Actions, you ensure that every tool in the Still Systems workshop is verified before it ever reaches a user. 

---

### 3. Predictable Milestones 
When planning updates for `nexus-v` or the package buckets, use a standard naming convention so your **Roadmap** is easy to follow: 
* **Versions:** `v1.0.0-stable`, `v1.1.0-beta` 
* **Time-based:** `2026-Q2-Roadmap`, `2026-Q3-Release`
